## IQ: A molecular network-based chemical novelty index for prioritizing samples using untargeted metabolomics in natural products discovery

### Description

IQ development focused on prioritizing individuals using three key network metrics: the number if unannotated nodes, the Shannon index (SI) of Match Quality Scores for annotated nodes, and the Shannon Index for cosine values measuring the connection between annotated and unannotated nodes.
