## IQ: A molecular network-based chemical novelty index for prioritizing samples using untargeted metabolomics in natural products discovery

### Description

IQ is a molecular network-based spectral annotation novelty index developed for prioritizing samples according to the probability of finding novel chemistry using mass spectrometry. IQ uses three key network metrics: Library match score (MQS) for annotated nodes, cosine values between annotated and unannotated nodes (COS), and the proportion of annotated nodes.
