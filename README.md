## IQ: A molecular network-based chemical novelty index for prioritizing samples using untargeted metabolomics in natural products discovery

### Description

IQ development focused on prioritizing individuals using three key network metrics: the number if unannotated nodes, the Shannon index (SI) of Match Quality Scores for annotated nodes, and the SI for cosine values measuring the connection between annotated and unannotated nodes.
